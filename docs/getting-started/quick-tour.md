## What is DICOM Fabricator?

DICOM Fabricator is a tool that helps you:
- **Generate synthetic DICOM studies** for testing
- **Manage patient records** with realistic data
- **Connect to image servers** (PACS) for testing
- **Transfer studies** between different servers
- **Test DICOM workflows** safely

## Key Features Overview

### üè• Patient Management
Create and manage synthetic patient records with realistic demographics.

**What you can do:**
- Add new patients with custom information
- Search and filter patient records
- Export patient data
- Generate realistic patient demographics

### üìã DICOM Generation
Generate synthetic DICOM studies from HL7 messages or manual input.

**What you can do:**
- Create studies from HL7 ORM messages
- Generate studies manually with custom parameters
- Preview study metadata before saving
- Create multiple studies for the same patient

### üñ•Ô∏è DICOM Viewer
View and manage generated DICOM files with detailed metadata display.

**What you can do:**
- Browse through generated studies
- View detailed DICOM metadata
- Download DICOM files
- Send studies to image servers

### üè• PACS Integration
Connect to and manage image servers (PACS) for testing.

**What you can do:**
- Add and configure PACS servers
- Test server connectivity
- Query studies on servers
- Transfer studies between servers

### üîê User Management
Control access with role-based permissions.

**What you can do:**
- Create user accounts
- Assign roles and permissions
- Separate test and production access
- Integrate with enterprise systems

## User Roles Explained

| Role | What They Can Do | Best For |
|------|------------------|----------|
| **admin** | Everything - manage users, configure servers, access all features | System administrators |
| **test_write** | Work with test image servers - query, send, and move studies | Test environment users |
| **test_read** | View test image servers - can only look, not make changes | Test environment viewers |
| **prod_write** | Work with production image servers - query, send, and move studies | Production users |
| **prod_read** | View production image servers - can only look, not make changes | Production viewers |

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Setup
- Install DICOM Fabricator
- Configure authentication (optional)
- Set up test PACS servers (optional)

### 2. Create Test Data
- Add patient records
- Generate DICOM studies
- Review generated data

### 3. Test Integration
- Configure PACS servers
- Send studies to servers
- Query studies from servers
- Transfer studies between servers

### 4. Production Testing
- Configure production PACS
- Test with production users
- Validate workflows

## Environment Separation

DICOM Fabricator separates test and production environments:

### Test Environment
- Safe for testing and development
- Contains synthetic data only
- Accessible to test users
- No risk to real patient data

### Production Environment
- Real clinical data
- Restricted access
- Production users only
- Full security controls

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Synthetic Data Only**: All generated data is fictional
- **Local Storage**: No data transmitted to external services
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission control
- **Environment Separation**: Test and production isolation

### Enterprise Integration
- **Active Directory**: Connect to corporate user systems
- **SAML Support**: Single sign-on integration
- **Group Mapping**: Map corporate groups to roles
- **Audit Logging**: Track user activities
